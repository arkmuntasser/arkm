title: About Me
---

I’m Amir R Muntasser; I’m a **web developer** from **Tucson, Arizona**. I build tools and products that empower tourist destinations to highlight the sights, events, and culture that make them special.

I’ve been building websites since 2010; I’ve done the freelance thing, but I’m presently the **Senior Lead Developer of CMS Operations** at [Simpleview](https://www.simpleviewinc.com). The sites I’ve worked on range from small, locally-owned businesses like [SWS Computers](https://www.shopsws.com/) to big community sites like [Rooster Teeth](https://roosterteeth.com/community/) all the way up to tourism sites for entire countries like [Visit Norway](https://www.visitnorway.com/).

I’m born and raised in Tucson, AZ, but I am the son of an immigrant. My dad came here from Libya when he was 17. My mother, though born here, is Mexican. I’m an **Arab** and a **Muslim**. I’m a **Libyan** and an **American**. This heritage has given me a unique view of the world and my place in it.

At home, I live for quiet nights in with my love, [Becks](https://twitter.com/beccabummer), and our 3 cats: Mercutio (My perfect prince), Lady, and Pizza.

## Previous Gigs

### Host/Writer/Video Editor

My friends and I ran a fabulously unsuccessful MCN (multi-channel network) on YouTube. There were roughly 5 channels in our network; most were gaming related, but the main one was a comedic news-focused channel.

Additionally, I produced a series of different shows, one-off videos, and reviews for a local electronics and hobbyist store in town. I more or less handled everything from writing, filming, editing, hosting, researching, and whatever else was needed. I would put out videos every other day on weekdays. It was a ton of fun and I learned a lot about editing and telling a story.

Also I made [this wonderful work of art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN6Tg5nbdHU).

### Founder

After college I needed a job and figured making one was a solid idea. My idea was a site where you could collaborate on homework assignments with your classmates. I had absolutely zero experience with web development at the time so I began teaching myself the LAMP stack. Several months later I had a working, albeit unattractive, prototype. It was a lot of long nights... and a lot of Ally McBeal.

I shut down development because life happens and I needed a regular paycheck, but it was a fantastic learning experience.

### Small Business Owner

For a brief period I owned a cell phone store; I was a Cricket Wireless franchisee. The market changed and Cricket stopped being so liberal with who they let franchise. The biggest lesson I took away from the experience was how to build and train a team. It's something I've been able to make use of in my current position overseeing a department's worth of developers (roughly 25 devs).
