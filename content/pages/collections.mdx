## Shoes

My love of shoes started relatively recently when [Jen Bartel](https://www.jenbartel.com/) partnered with Adidas to make the limited edition Captain Marvel UltraBoosts. And then it was the Nike Adapt Huaraches that really locked me in (they're robot shoes!).

Though I enjoy collecting shoes I find pretty, I try not to be too precious about them and will wear them out

## Apple Computers & Devices

I worked at a local electonics store a long time ago when a customer brought in a Apple Macintosh M0001 to trade in. The store owner didn't care about this awesome piece of history that just got dropped in his lap so he sold it to me for basically nothing.

Since then I've been working on collection pivotal "firsts" in Apple's history.

- [Apple Macintosh 128K M0001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K)
- [Apple iPhone (1st Generation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)) w/ [Apple Bluetooth Headset](https://appleinsider.com/articles/07/07/30/review_apple_iphone_bluetooth_headset)
- Apple iMac (2nd Generation)
- [Apple iBook G3 "Clamshell" - Tangerine](https://www.macstories.net/mac/the-clamshell-ibook-g3/)
- Apple Watch (1st Generation)
- [Apple iPod (1st Generation)](https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/IPod_(1st_generation))
