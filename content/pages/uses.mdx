| Gear            | The Deets                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| MacBook Pro 16" | The standard web developer computer cuz ya boy is basic. |
| VS Code         | You use, I use, we all use it. |
| Synthwave84     | I'm from the 80's. It looks like the 80's. Peanut butter and chocolate. |
| Cascadia Code   | This has been the most comfortable to read font I've found for programming and it even has support for ligatures! My Only wish is that they would make a trye italic version. [Download it](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code). |
| ZSH             | Specifically Oh My ZSH with the [Spacehip Prompt](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/). |
| HomePod Mini    | I actually like Siri and think it works well. |
| LG 32" UltraFine<br />Display Ergo 4K      | It's big, it's 4K, it swivels. Perfection. |



## Video Gamering
| Gear/Games          | The Deets |
|---------------|--|
| Switch        | Everything should be on Switch. I don't want to sit in front of the TV and play a game. I want to sit in bed or on the toilet and play a game. Every game. Freedom. |
| Pokemon       | Fire starter always. Everything is weak to fire. Water? Boil it. Grass? Burn it. Fire? Absorb it. No meta, just power. My pokemon hits their pokemon, their pokemon hits the pavement. First hit, best hit. |
| Mario         | Kart and platforming. Pure joy, baby. |
| Smash         | I love my beautiful anime boys. Cloud and Terry are best boys. Pyra is queen. |
| Xbox Series X<br/>& GamePass | If it's not on Switch, then this is where I'm doing my gaming. |
| PlayStation 5 | My wife mostly plays on this. For me, it's just a Final Fantasy VII Remake machine. |
| Final Fantasy VII         | This is my favorite game of all time. Both the original and the new remake. I can't begin to say how informative and influential this game was when I was a kid growing up. It's hard to say how all this game shaped me, but I'm pretty sure it made me bi. And the remake was like how I saw it in my mind kicked into overdrive. |
