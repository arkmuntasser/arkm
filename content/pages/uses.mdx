Here's generally all the tools I use to get things done. None of the links below are affiliate links so click and buy to your heart's content knowing full well that I wont benefit from it in the slightest in a monetary fashion. But if you bang a gong after clicking and buy from any of these links I will hear it and smile knowingly.

## Hardware
### Work

I have a work provided development laptop. It's an uninspired Lenovo ThinkPad. Nothing really write home about as far as specs go, but it gets the job done nicely without any slowdown.

I have this laptop connected to an [LG 32" UltraFine Display Ergo 4K](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-32un880-b-4k-uhd-led-monitor) monitor. I sometimes wish I had gone with an ultra-wide, but live and learn.

For keyboard and mouse I use an [Apple Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Compatible-v-10-6-8-Versions/dp/B07K7V1FWC/) and the [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-mouse/8vq1d8qsvt22) respectively.

Lastly, I've got a [Logitech C270 720p WebCam](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c270-hd-webcam.960-000694.html).

### Personal

My personal computer is a [MacBook Pro 16" 2019](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/). It's just the bottom tier of that model which is more than enough for me, but I'm really looking forward to what an Applie Silicon version of it is going to be. If for nothing else I'm going to upgrade for battery improvements alone as this thing has abysmal battery life.

## Software
### Editor + Terminal

I, like most, am fully on the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) bandwagon after years of using Sublime Text and Atom. It has all the flexibility and extendability that I loved about Atom, but the raw power and performance that kept bringing me back to Sublime Text. Microsoft knows how to make software, who knew?

I also use it as my primary note taking application for work. I just keep a running markdown file of notes from meetings and transpose them later as needed.

It's also the primary way I access the terminal. If I'm on Windows I use [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) and on MacOS I use [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) with the [Spaceship Prompt](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/).

My preferred theme is non-Neon Dreams form of [Synthwave84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) and my go to font is [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).

### Office

I use the Google Workspace for all my email, calendar, and typical office suite needs. I actually really like all the changes they've done to GMail for work, I just wish there was better Drive, Calendar, and Meet integration so I truly wouldn't have to leave that one tab if I didn't want to.
