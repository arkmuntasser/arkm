A child screams in the back, a father desperately holds back the police brutality from reaching his family. He is overwhelmed.

But they threw rocks.

A family sits down to celebrate a holiday together when a bomb is dropped on their house. Eid mubarak.

But they threw rocks.

Hundreds arrested to never be seen again, hundreds more ripped from their homes and tossed into the streets to die.

But they threw rocks.

A city burns for days under a relentless wave of firebombs; no one can flee. Trapped by walls ever closing in; efficieny in cruelty disguised as bureaucracy.

But they threw rocks.

Hospitals and houses of worship destroyed; no where is safe and no where is sacred and no war crime is too extreme.

But they threw rocks.

Children dead. Medics scour the rubble to collect enough pieces of babies so their parents have something to bury.

But they threw rocks.

Why did they have to throw those damn rocks?
