- Absolutely [loved this video analyzing the architecture in Final Fantasy VII Remake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG7WzStbnzg) by the brilliant [Simone de Rochefort](https://twitter.com/doomquasar) of [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/). The original PSX version of the game had to do a lot of environmental storytelling because of the limitation of the platform. It's incredible to see all the work that went into lovingly recreating all these environments and expanding on them to make the world all the more real and lived in.
