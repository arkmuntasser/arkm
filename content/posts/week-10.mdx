- I withdrew from consideration from a promotion and I feel pretty great about it.
- I'm still working my way through the Yuffie mission in *FFVIIR*, but I love everything about it!
- I used "troika" in a sentence this week so you know I've been bringing my top-tier bullshit.
- Light week over all.
