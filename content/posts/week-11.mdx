- *Loki*, so far, is very good, but it's the most agonizing to watch week to week. Especially that last episode. You can't just end an episode like that. It's not even a cliffhanger it just kind of ended in the middle.
- Becks and I finished *Lupin* this week. I'm excited that there is going to be a Part 3, but I was totally content with the ending of Part 2 being the series finale. I kind of wish it was. It wass sad, but romantic in a way.
- Ya'll see that Windows 11 announcement? It was so weird! Microsoft just doesn't know how to do a presentation. Panos seemed like he was going to breakdown and cry the entire time. He kept looking over to the prompter. And then like halfway through they started doing this strange transition between scenes. Why was it like this? Everyone else figured out how to make a good engaging commericial for thier new stuff. Baffling. Windows 11 itself looks alright. It's Windows. The centering of the start menu is terrible; the time is still in the right corner so the whole OS looks unbalanced and pull the eye to the right. Thankfully there's an option to put the start menu on the left to fix this. I was hoping they would have taken this chance to get rid of the Ribbon interface. It just doesn't work. At least for me. I can't figure out my way around it and always end up wasting time trying to look through it to find features.
- We found this series from Delish on YouTube where this lady goes around theme parks and eats all the food there. It's our new go to show. The host, Tess, is so catty and obnoxious in the most delightful way.
- I've been catching up on *Dungeons & Daddies* and it continues to be one of the all time best D&D podcasts around. The most recent episode I've listened to, "Mark! A Vagrant", was one of the funniest things I've ever heard.
- I just watch *Luca* tonight. A movie about sea monsters in Italy that want to buy a Vespa. It was as adorable as you might expect it to be from that description.
- I downloaded the new Safari Technical Preview and have been playing with the new tab bar. Because of I've implemented a dark mode on my site, you may have already noticed it based on your settings. I know it's not a popular opinion, but I really like the new Safari design so far. I think people just have a lot more tabs open than I do; I usually have no more than 2 or 3 when just casually surfing and maybe like 15 or when working.
- I've got the house all to myself this weekend. Becks is taking a mini-vacation with her mom. You know what that means, hehe... That's right! More time for me to spend working on the additional work I've decided to take on because I clearly hate myself a whole bunch.
