- I was not emotionally ready for *[Invincible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invincible_(TV_series))* to be where it's at even though I knew it was coming. I never read the comic and have no idea what direction this is going to go.
- I built a fun thing I'm calling a [Warbly Grid](https://warbly-grid.glitch.me). You can hover over the grid with your mouse and the grid animates in a satisfying warbly way.
- Nearly 2 weeks into Ramadan. The days are long, but the weeks fly by. It doesn't help that the days are literally getting longer.
- Getting my 2nd vaccine shot this weekend! God I'm so looking forward to being done with this pandemic. I desperately want to be able to just go to a restaurant or a movie. Sadly, not everyone shares this elation toward the vaccine. The past week I've been dealing with friends and family refusing to get it because the right-wing death cult propaganda has gotten to them. It breaks my heart because there was a chance we could have celebrated the Eid together this year if they would just get it, but no.
- You know I bought some [AirTags](https://www.apple.com/airtag/); 4 pack, bay-beeeeeee! Going to pick me up that new Siri Remote next week as well.
- The 2 of my employees that I mentioned last week continue to impress and it makes me incredibly happy to see them rising to the challenge.
