- Eid Mubarak! I hope everyone managed to have a good one. It was and still is very tough.
- What should have a been a joyous time for all Muslims was instead a horror as we watched the atrocities being committed on the Palestinians by the Israeli government. I can't imagine what they are going through. My heart hurts and I'm so angry.
- On top of that I've been really missing my mom lately. I went to one her favorite restaurants on the Eid to feel a bit closer to her. It was my first time at a restaurant in over a year. It was rough.
