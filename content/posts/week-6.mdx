- I'm an old now and I get excited about updates to productivity software. I'm so jazzed about all the [updates coming to Google Workspace](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440226/google-workspace-smart-canvas-features-docs-updates).
- We finished Shadow and Bone on Netflix. It's a rough watch until episode 5 which is when the show actually starts. And once it starts it doesn't stop! Except for all the parts with the lady and the witch hunter because they have 0 chemistry and it's a non-stop cringe fest.
- Finally a ceasefire. Israel is no longer actively bombing Palestinians to hell and are just back to their normal amount of ethnic cleansing.
- My collection grows! I am now the proud owner of an original iPod.
- Speaking of Apple stuff, the new Siri Remote arrived today and oh my god it's so much better. I feel stupid because it's just a remote, but it's the little annoyances in life that really add up.
- Watched Army of the Dead tonight. When Zack Synder stops being up his own ass he can actually make a pretty solid and enjoyable movie.
