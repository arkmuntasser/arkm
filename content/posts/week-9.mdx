- I'm a fucking moron and took on another extra project and have lost my weekends like a dumb dumb. I'm so tired, but I want the extra money. I don't *need* the extra money, I **want** it. After the last year and a half my wife and I deserve an extra specail vacation and this is how I make that happen for us.
- I went for a promotion at work, but I think I'm going to bow out. I know I would do well in the position, but I don't think I would be happy in it. I went for it because I always go for it. That's always how I've been. I see something I deem as "next" or "better" and I immediately try to grasp for it. Maybe not this time though. ...I did show up to the interview in the loudest, most obnoxious outfit I could muster and it was cool as hell.
- WWDC was this week there wasn't a new MBP and so it was a terrible WWDC. That's actually not true, I thought it was a fantastic WWDC and I'm excited for all the update, but none more so than the new Safari. First, I dig the new design. Two, I'm excited to see how I can make use of the new tab bar within my site designs. Three, `lch()` color syntax is finally here!
- I'm downloading *FFVIIR Intergrade* as we speak!
- I've learned the hard way that spicy curry noodles + cajun hot wings + pasta = a very bad time.
- I'm still thinking about *Cruella*.
- I'm also thinking about *Loki* which was such a blast and I'm incredibly jazzed to see where it goes.
- Have you tried that new Spatial Audio shit in Apple Music? I was listening to The Weeknd and it was terrible! Totally butchered every song. Luckily you can turn that shit off and listen to the original master. However, a lot of rock sounds pretty good in Spatial Audio. I'm looking forward to hearing some old school metal; that should be radical.
- I need to start building more interesting things and learning more things. As much as I try to keep current I feel like I'm always so far behind.
- Becks and I went on a date! It's our first real date in a long while. We went to this World of Wonder thing at the mall. It was just a bunch of small art installations and selfie rooms. It was a lot of fun. It was nice to just be out of the house and doing something fun and random.
